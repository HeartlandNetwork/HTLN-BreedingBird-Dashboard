# HTLN-BreedingBird-Dashboard

Developing a generic workflow for visualizing breeding bird data package. Goals include 1) a generic ETL script written in R that will ingest csv files and EML metadata and 2) a set of EDA visualization tools written in ggplot that are 
Power BI compatible.

The folder 'src' is my dumping ground for code and visuals. .pbix files that
actually work will be located in the pbix folder. Thanks for reading!
